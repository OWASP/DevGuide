The OWASP [Mobile Application Security][masproject] (MAS) flagship project provides
industry standards for mobile application security.

The OWASP MAS project provides the [Mobile Application Security Verification Standard][masvs] (MASVS)
for mobile applications and a comprehensive [Mobile Application Security Testing Guide][mastg] (MASTG).

The [Mobile Application Security Checklist][masc] contains links to the MASTG test cases for each MASVS control.

#### What is MAS Checklist?

The MAS Checklist provides a checklist that keeps track of the MASTG test cases for a given MASVS control.
This MAS Checklist is split out into categories that match the MASVS categories:

* [MASVS-STORAGE](https://mas.owasp.org/checklists/MASVS-STORAGE/) sensitive data storage
* [MASVS-CRYPTO](https://mas.owasp.org/checklists/MASVS-CRYPTO/) cryptography best practices
* [MASVS-AUTH](https://mas.owasp.org/checklists/MASVS-AUTH/) authentication and authorization mechanisms
* [MASVS-NETWORK](https://mas.owasp.org/checklists/MASVS-NETWORK/) network communications
* [MASVS-PLATFORM](https://mas.owasp.org/checklists/MASVS-PLATFORM/) interactions with the mobile platform
* [MASVS-CODE](https://mas.owasp.org/checklists/MASVS-CODE/) platform and data entry points along with third-party software
* [MASVS-RESILIENCE](https://mas.owasp.org/checklists/MASVS-RESILIENCE/) integrity and running on a trusted platform
* [MASVS-PRIVACY](https://mas.owasp.org/checklists/MASVS-PRIVACY/) privacy of users, data and resources

In addition to the web links there is a [downloadable spreadsheet][masxls].

#### Why use it?

The OWASP MASVS is the industry standard for [mobile application security][csmas].
If the MASTG is being applied to a mobile application then the MAS Checklist is a handy reference
that can also be used for compliance purposes.

#### How to use it

The [online version][masc] is useful to list the MASVS controls and which MASTG tests apply.
Follow the links to access the individual controls and tests.

The [spreadsheet download][masxls] allows the status of each test to be recorded,
with a separate sheet for each MASVS category.
This record of test results can be used as evidence for compliance purposes.
