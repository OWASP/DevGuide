OWASP Nettacker is a command line utility for automated network and vulnerability scanning.
It can be used during penetration testing for both internal and external security assessments of networks.

The Nettacker [breaker/tool project][nettacker-project] is an OWASP Incubator Project;
the latest version can be downloaded from the project's [github repository][nettacker-install].

#### What is Nettacker?

[Nettacker][nettacker-project] is an automated penetration testing tool.
It is used to scan a network to discover nodes and servers on the network including subdomains.
Nettacker can then identify servers, services and port numbers in use.

Nettacker is a modular python application that that can be extended with other scanning functions.
The many modules available are grouped into domains:

* [Scan][nettacker-scan] modules for reconnaissance
* [Vulnerability][nettacker-vuln] modules that attempt specific exploits
* [Brute force][nettacker-brute] modules

Nettacker runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

#### Why use it?

Nettacker is easy to use from the command line, making it easy to use in scripts,
and also comes with a web browser interface for easy navigation of the results.
This makes it a quick and reliable way to gain information from a network.

Nettacker can be used both for auditing purposes and also for penetration testing.

#### How to use it

The OWASP Spotlight series provides an overview of attack surface management using Nettacker:
'Project 11 - [Nettacker][spotlight11]'.

The documentation for Nettacker is provided in the repository wiki pages;
follow [these instructions][nettacker-install] to install it.

Nettacker is a flexible and modular scanning tool that can be used in many ways and with many options.
