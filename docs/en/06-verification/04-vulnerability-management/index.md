[Verification][sammv] is one of the business functions described by the [OWASP SAMM][samm].
Vulnerability management helps maintain the application security level after bug fixes, changes or during maintenance.

The SAMM [Requirements-driven Testing][sammvrt] practice describes the outcomes for effective vulnerability management,
and why it is necessary to have these processes in place.
For example using security unit tests to provide regression testing
gives some degree of confidence that applications are not vulnerable to known exploits.
