Security gap analysis and security gap evaluation are central to Governance, Risk & Compliance activities
and are used to gain and maintain certification to a management system standard
such as [ISO 27001][iso27001] 'Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection'.

Guidance is important for these analysis and evaluation activities, with the OWASP projects [SAMM][samm],
[MASVS][masvs] and [ASVS][asvs] providing this information and advice.

The OWASP Developer Guide is a community effort; if there is something that needs changing then [submit an issue][issue1301].
