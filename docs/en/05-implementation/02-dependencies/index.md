Management of software dependencies is described by the SAMM [Software Dependencies][sammisbsd] activity,
which in turn is part of the SAMM [Secure Build][sammisb] security practice
within the [Implementation][sammi] business function.

It is important to record all dependencies used throughout the application in a production environment.
This can be achieved by Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify the third party dependencies.

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) provides a record of the dependencies within the system / application,
and provides information on each dependency so that it can be tracked :

* Where it is used or referenced
* Version used
* License
* Source information and repository
* Support and maintenance status of the dependency

Having an SBOM provides the ability to quickly find out which applications are affected by a specific
[Common Vulnerability and Exposure][cve] (CVE), or what CVEs are present in a particular application.
