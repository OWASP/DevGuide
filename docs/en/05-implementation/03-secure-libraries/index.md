The use of secure libraries is part of the technology management that helps to fulfill security requirements.
Standard libraries enable the adoption of common design patterns and security solutions,
and provide standardized technologies and frameworks that can be used throughout different applications.

[Technology Management][sammdsatm] for the software applications is described by SAMM as an activity
within the SAMM [Security Architecture][sammdsa] security practice
which in turn is part of the [Design][sammd] business function.
