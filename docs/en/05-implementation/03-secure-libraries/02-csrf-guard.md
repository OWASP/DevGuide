OWASP [CSRFGuard][csrfguard] is a security control that helps protect Java applications
against [Cross-Site Request Forgery][cscsrf] (CSRF) attacks.

The CSRFGuard Builder/Breaker Tool project is an OWASP Production Project
and is being actively maintained by a pool of international volunteers.

#### What is CSRFGuard?

OWASP [CSRFGuard][csrfguard] is a library that implements a variant of the synchronizer token pattern to mitigate
the risk of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks for Java applications.

The OWASP CSRFGuard library is integrated through the use of a JavaEE Filter and exposes various automated
and manual ways to integrate per-session or pseudo-per-request tokens into HTML.
When a user interacts with this HTML, CSRF prevention tokens are submitted with the corresponding HTTP request.
CSRFGuard ensures the token is present and is valid for the current HTTP request.

#### Why use it?

The OWASP CSRFGuard library is widely used for Java applications, and will help mitigate against CSRF.

#### How to use it

Pre-compiled versions of the CSRFGuard library can be downloaded from
the [Maven Central repository][csrfguard-maven] or the [OSS Sonatype Nexus][csrfguard-nexus] repository.

Follow the [instructions][csrfguard-build] to build CSRFGuard into the Java application using Maven.
