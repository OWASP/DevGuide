Documentation is used here as part of the SAMM [Training and Awareness][sammgegta] activity,
which in turn is part of the SAMM [Education & Guidance][sammgeg] security practice
within the [Governance][sammg] business function.

It is important that development teams have good documentation on security techniques, frameworks, tools and threats.
Documentation helps to promote security awareness for all teams involved in software development,
and provides guidance on building security into applications and systems.
