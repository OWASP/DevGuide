Culture building and Process maturing is described by the SAMM [Organization and Culture][sammgegoc] activity,
which in turn is part of the SAMM [Education & Guidance][sammgeg] security practice
within the [Governance][sammg] business function.

The maturity of security processes and culture is wide ranging, with indicators of a mature process and culture including:

* Security champions have been identified for each development team
* A program is in place to support the security champions
* Secure coding practices are in place to define standards and improve software development
* Developers and application security professionals across the organization are able to communicate and share best practice
