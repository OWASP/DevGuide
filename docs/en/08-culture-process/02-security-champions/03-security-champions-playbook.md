The [Security Champions Playbook][sec-champs] is a project that describes the process of establishing
a Security Champions program within an organization.

#### What are Security Champions?

Security Champions are active members of a team that act as a core element of the security assurance process
within a product or service.
They are often are the initial point of contact within the team when it comes to security concerns and incidents.

Some advantages of encouraging Security Champions within a team are :

* Scaling security through multiple teams
* Engaging non-security engineers in security
* Establishing the security culture throughout an organization

The Security Champion should be given extra training to carry out this role,
which is often in addition to their existing responsibilities.

#### How to use the playbook

Security Champions Playbook lists six steps which include general recommendations:

1. [Identify teams](https://github.com/c0rdis/security-champions-playbook/blob/master/Security%20Playbook/1.%20Identify%20teams.md)
2. [Define the role](https://github.com/c0rdis/security-champions-playbook/blob/master/Security%20Playbook/2.%20Define%20the%20role.md)
3. [Nominate Champions](https://github.com/c0rdis/security-champions-playbook/blob/master/Security%20Playbook/3.%20Nominate%20Champions.md)
4. [Set up communication channels](https://github.com/c0rdis/security-champions-playbook/blob/master/Security%20Playbook/4.%20Set%20up%20communication%20channels.md)
5. [Build solid knowledge base](https://github.com/c0rdis/security-champions-playbook/blob/master/Security%20Playbook/5.%20Build%20solid%20knowledge%20base.md)
6. [Maintain interest](https://github.com/c0rdis/security-champions-playbook/blob/master/Security%20Playbook/6.%20Maintain%20interest.md)

Use these recommendations to build up a Security Champions program that is tailored to the needs of the organization.
