There are various foundational concepts and terminology that are commonly used in software security.
Although many of these concepts are complex to implement and are based on heavy-duty theory,
the principles are often fairly straight forward and are accessible for every software engineer.

A reasonable grasp of these foundational concepts allows development teams to understand and implement
software security for the application or system under development.
This Developer Guide can only give a brief overview of these concepts,
for in-depth knowledge refer to the many texts on security such as the [The Cyber Security Body Of Knowledge][cbok].

If changes are being introduced to the security culture of an organization
then make sure there is management buy-in and clear goals to achieve.
Without these then attempts to improve the security posture will probably fail - see the
[Security Culture][culturegoal] project for the importance of getting management,
security and development teams working together.
