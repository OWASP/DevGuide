Here is a collection of Do's and Don'ts when it comes to cryptographic practices, gathered from practical experiences.

* The basis for usage of PKI is to address (using encryption and hashing)
* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Authentication
* Non-repudiation
* Cryptography is used for the following:
  * Data-at-rest protection using data encrypting keys and key encrypting keys. For which,
* Do not use custom cryptographic algorithms / deprecated algorithms
* Do not use passwords as cryptographic keys
* Do not hard-code cryptographic keys in the application
* Persist secret keys in a secure vault like HSM, KMS, Secrets Manager
* Manage encryption keys through the lifecycle, including key retirement/replacement
    when someone who has access leaves the organization
* Rotate keys on a regular basis. However this depends on the key strength and the algorithm used.
    If the key strength is low, the rotation period will be smaller
* Maintain a contingency plan to recover data in the event of an encrypted key being lost
* Ensure the code eliminates secrets from memory.
* Maintain a contingency plan that can recover data in the event of an encrypted key being lost
* Store keys away from the data
* Do not use IV twice for a fixed key
* Communication security
* Ensure no sensitive data is transmitted in the clear, internally or externally.
* Validate certificates properly against the hostnames/users for whom they are meant
* Failed TLS connections should not fall back to an insecure connection
* Do not use IV twice for a fixed key
* Cryptography in general
* All protocols and algorithms for authentication and secure communication
    should be well vetted by the cryptographic community.
* Perform Message integrity checking by using a combined mode of operation, or a MAC based on a block cipher.
* Do not use key sizes less than 128 bits or cryptographic hash functions with output sizes less than 160 bits.
* Do not use custom cryptographic algorithms that have not been vetted by cryptography community
* Do not hardcode cryptographic keys in applications?
* Issue keys using a secure means.
* Maintain a key lifecycle for the organization (Creation, Storage, Distribution and installation, Use,
    Rotation, Backup, Recovery, Revocation, Suspension, Destruction)
* Lock and unlock symmetric secret keys securely
* Maintain CRL (Certificate Revocation Lists) maintained on a real-time basis
* Validate certificates properly against the hostnames/users for whom they are meant
* Ensure the code eliminates secrets from memory
* Specific encryption, in addition to SSL
* Mask or remove keys from logs
* Use salted hashes when using MD5 or any such less secure algorithms
* Use known encryption algorithms, do not create your own as they will almost certainly be less secure
* Persist secret keys in a secure vault like HSM, KMS, Secrets Manager
* Do not use IV twice for a fixed key
* Ensure that cryptographic randomness is used where appropriate,
    and that it has not been seeded in a predictable way or with low entropy.
    Most modern APIs do not require the developer to seed the CSPRNG to get security.
