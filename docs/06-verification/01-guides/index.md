### 6.1 Verification guides

[Verification][sammv] is one of the business functions described by the [OWASP SAMM][samm].
The verification activities are wide ranging, and will include:

* Testing of security controls
* Review of controls and security mechanisms
* Evaluation and assessment of the security architecture
* and others

Given the breadth of techniques and knowledge required, guides are an important resource for verification activities.
