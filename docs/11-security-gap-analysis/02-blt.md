The OWASP [Bug Logging Tool][blt] (BLT) is a community database of bugs found in an organization's web site or application.
BLT is an OWASP Production tool project and has its own [bug recording site][bltsite].

#### What is BLT?

BLT is a bug recording and bounty tool that allows external users to register and advise
about bugs in an organization's web site or application.
It allows an organization to run a bug bounty program without having to go through a commercial provider.

The [BLT core project][bltcore] provides a development server docker image that can be used for the
bug bounty program.
The [BLT-Flutter application][bltapp] provides an integrated method for reporters/users to report bugs.
The [BLT Extension][bltchrome] is a Chrome extension that helps BLT reporters/users
to take screenshots and add them to a BLT website.

#### Why use it?

Bug bounty programs are an important path for reporting security bugs to an organization.
These programs can be paid-for services provided by commercial companies, or they can be provided by
the company / organization itself; and this is where BLT can help.

External reporters of bugs in web sites and applications are a valuable way of identifying security
related bugs and issues; it provides a diverse range of individuals to hunt for bugs.
BLT can provide the route for these security bugs to be responsibly disclosed to the organization.

#### How to use it

BLT has its own [bug recording site][bltsite] which can be used to disclose any type of bug in any web site.
Ideally this is not used for security related bugs because these bugs need [responsible disclosure][csdisclose].
The organization should run its own [BLT core site][bltcore] to accept submission of security related bugs,
and encourage users/reporters to use the [BLT app][bltapp] and chrome [extension][bltchrome].
