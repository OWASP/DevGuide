Vulnerable applications are useful for the Training and Education activities
described in the SAMM [Training and Awareness][sammgegta] section,
which in turn is part of the SAMM [Education & Guidance][sammgeg] security practice
within the [Governance][sammg] business function.

The intentionally-vulnerable applications provide a safe environment where various vulnerable targets can be attacked.
This provides practice in using various penetration tools available to a tester,
without the risk of attack traffic triggering intrusion detection systems.
The OWASP [Vulnerable Web Applications Directory Project][vwad] (VWAD) provides a comprehensive list of
available intentionally-vulnerable web applications:

* Vulnerable [mobile applications][vwad-mobile]
* [Offline][vwad-offline] vulnerable web applications
* [Containerized][vwad-containers] vulnerable web applications
* vulnerable web applications [available Online][vwad-online]
