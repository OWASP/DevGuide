## 7. Training and Education

Training and Education activities are described by in the SAMM [Training and Awareness][sammgegta] section,
which in turn is part of the SAMM [Education & Guidance][sammgeg] security practice
within the [Governance][sammg] business function.

The goal of security training and education is to increase the awareness of application security threats and risks
along with security best practices and secure software design principles.
The security awareness training should be customized for all roles currently involved in the management,
development, testing, or auditing of the applications and systems.
In addition a Learning Management System or equivalent should be in place to track
the employee training and certification processes.

It is important to provide activities for development teams;
we are all human and our security knowledge can become stale without a plan for refreshing it.
The [Security Culture][cultureacts] project describes various activities that can help developers
keep up to date and motivated.

OWASP provides various resources and environments that can help with this security training and education
ranging from vulnerable applications, training platforms and gamification.
