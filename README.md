# OWASP Developer Guide

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in the OWASP Developer Guide, the first major [Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org) Document. 

This is the development version of the OWASP Developer Guide, and will be converted into PDF & MediaWiki for publishing when complete. 

This repository is the current **development master: version 3.0.**

**Current stable is [version 2.0.1](https://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide/tree/dc5a2977a4797d9b98486417a5527b9f15d8a251/DevGuide2.0.1)** and is the recommended version for reading until 3.0 becomes more complete.

See our [our wiki](https://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide/wiki), [FAQ page](https://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide/wiki/FAQs), and [Road Map](https://github.com/OWASP/DevGuide/wiki/Road-Map) for more information.
