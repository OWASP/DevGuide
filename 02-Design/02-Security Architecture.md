# Security Architecture

Security architecture is not separate to the normal architecture of an application – it is an innate aspect of the architecture of even the simplest systems. Security architecture should be stable for at least two-three years in the average application. 

This chapter cannot distil the enormity of the security architecture profession - there are excellent texts available which we highly recommend if you want to learn more.

There are three major domains of security architecture:

* Enablement - common services, components, patterns and practices that enable security by default
* Identity and access control - the process of correlating evidence of identity to an account, and the management of the account by the individual
* Defensive Services - common (and some would consider traditional) security services that are present in all cloud and enterprise settings - firewalls, intrusion detection / prevention, Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM), certificates, adaptive / two factor authentication, logging and correlation engines.

It is important to realise that although security is the single non-functional requirement (NFR) shared by all programs of any size, there is not a single security architecture that suits all applications.

Each organization needs to define their own security policies, preferably based around global standards like ISO 27002 or COBIT, adopt security standards (such as the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard) and guidelines (such as this document), and secure software development life-cycle (SSDLC). 

Security is meaningless without two key intrinsic attributes:

* Senior management support - without senior management involvement(support), it is impossible to inculcate a security culture within the organisation, where security is an up front issue, and secure systems are not only expected, but are the norm.
* Data classification - It is possible to spend vast sums of money on useless security trinkets. If an organization does not understand where their critical assets lie, they cannot determine how best to protect them nor if they are spending too little (usually) or too much (not often, but this is a far worse outcome), or on the wrong assets.
